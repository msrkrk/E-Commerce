# E-Commerce Application Development during Internship

As part of our internship program, we developed a **fully functional e-commerce application** using **.NET 8 MVC** for the client-side application and **.NET 8 Web API** for backend services. The project was designed to provide a seamless online shopping experience, integrating essential features for both customers and administrators.

## Key Technologies and Features

- ✅ **Client Application:** Built with **.NET 8 MVC and Razor Pages**, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- ✅ **Backend API:** Developed using **.NET 8 Web API**, facilitating communication between the client app and the database.
- ✅ **Database Management:** Utilized **SQL Database** to store and manage products, orders, users, and transaction data.
- ✅ **Authentication & Security:** Implemented **Identity with JWT Token** for secure authentication and authorization.
- ✅ **Cloud Deployment & CI/CD:** Leveraged **Azure DevOps and Azure Portal** for source control, automated deployment, and application hosting.

## Application Functionality

- **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure login, registration, and role-based access for customers and administrators.
- **Product Management:** Admin panel to add, update, and delete products.
- **Shopping Cart & Checkout:** Customers can browse products, add them to the cart, and complete purchases securely.
- **Order Tracking:** Users can view their order history and track order status.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Includes sales reports, user management, and inventory tracking.

This project provided us with **hands-on experience in full-stack development**, **API integration**, and **cloud deployment**, helping us gain practical exposure to real-world software engineering practices.
